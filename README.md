<summary> Who am I?</summary>
<br>

 
I was an Assistant Director and Project Manager for a Market Research Firm, but after dabbling for the past few years I choose to quit my job to learn development full-time. I'm an very quick study looking for career opportunities in Software Development and Web Development. I am eagerly looking for chances to build my career, and corresponding skills. 
* I love learning new things, and am a creative problem solving enthusiast
* I have strong grasp on interpersonnel communication, have an extremly hard work ethic, and am always solution oriented
* I have a Bachelors degree in Marketing from The University of Pittsburgh
* Classically trained chef 🦀  🍅
  * Lucky enough to study under Michelin Star ⭐⭐⭐  awarded chefs, and was a recipient of the James Beard award for Best New Restaurant
* Ardent outdoor lover⛺ , and an ornate/functional blacksmith 🔨🔨
* Keen stock market player 📈 , and future real estate investor 🏡 🏡

✅ I feel like I would make a great addition to any team, as I work very well with others, and always stay busy working by myself
